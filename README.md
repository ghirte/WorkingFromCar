# WorkingFromCar
In that repository we collect all GAMS and R codes used to produce the paper 'Working from self-driving cars' (WFC) 
		by Georg Hirte, Ren√©e Laes, and Regine Gerike
		
	File WFCGenerateParamMC.Rmd is the R-Markdown file that is used to calculate all parameter distributions needed 
		in the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the model on working form self-driving cars. 
		The paramters are stored in the files MC_paramDE.gdx and MC_paramUS.gdx.
		
	File WFC_ParamSim_Countries_AllParam_Final_pbcorrect_2022_09_26.gms is a GAMS file. 
		It includes the simulation code for the impact of single parameter changes on WFC and the Monte Carlo simulations. 
		The GAMS program uses MC_paramDE.gdx and MC_paramUS.gdx as inputs and provides a number of output files OUtMobileWOrk_....gdx. 
		E.g. OutMobileWork_tauw.gdx includes the results form the variation in the wage tax rate tauw,
		OutMobileWork_Benchmark.gdx is the outcome from the benchmark parameter choice, and OutMobileWork_MonteCarlo.gdx is the outcome
		of the Monte Carlo simulation.
		
	File WFCPresentResults20220631.RMD is the R-Markdown file to finalize the results form the GAMS simulations, 
		make regressions on the MC outcomes, and produce tables and results used in the paper. Inputs are the outcome *.gdx files.
		
	We also added the knitted R-Markdown .pdf files for both R-Markdown files.
